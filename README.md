# RPi_Server-PG
This is a simple server that uses the new communication method (RexC) between the Raspberry Pi server (RPI_Server) and the main e-lab server (Main_server). This project serves to familiarize the new experience developers to make their own graphical interfaces and communication protocols between the experiment controllers and the RPI_Server.

# RPi_Proxy
This is a simple server that uses the new communication method (FREE) between the Raspberry Pi (RPI_Proxy) and the main e-lab server (FREE_Web). This project serves to familiarize the new experience developers to make their own graphical interfaces and communication protocols between the experiment controllers and the RPI_Proxy.
